## Game Galaxy
Game Galaxy is a full-stack, video game e-commerce web application meant to allow users the ability to view, compare, and purchase video games online. It was primarily developed using Java, JavaScript, & Spring. Users can create and login to an account in order to see all games we have available or even a customized list of games. They can Wishlist their favorite games and interact with the site to change the aesthetics. The main purpose, though, is to allow our users to find and purchase a game that fits within their interests and budget. Our team was tasked with providing testing coverage for this version of Game Galaxy and creating appropriate documentation to support our work. We were not asked to develop any new feature or rectify any existing mistakes.

## MVP's
- Achieve 90% unit test coverage
- Test a set of 11 different user stories
- Create documentation of the entire process

## Front-End
Our front-end team was in charge of simulating User Stories and ensuring that the practical features of our website were behaving accordingly. Commonly used steps in our browser testing were reused in order to decrease the total amount of code to be written, thus saving time and increasing our efficiency. Our team utilized Cucumber and Selenium to automate our Chrome browser testing in a Windows environment.

## Back-End
Our back-end team was tasked with developing and implementing unit tests for our Controller and Service layers. We planned our strategy before starting work to determine the what was needed to cover all possible test cases. Equivalence partitioning attempts to identify test cases that reveal classes of errors, thus reducing the total number of test cases that need to be developed. One advantage of this approach is a reduction in the time it takes to develop test software because of fewer test cases. Unit tests were written using JUnit 5 as our testing framework, and dependencies were mocked using Mockito.

## Startup

In order to facilitate a smooth transition between developers, we have compiled a list of requirements and instructions on how to get the application running on a local machine. These instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Revature-TestingCapstone-1352/220531-JWA-Project-3/blob/main/STARTUP.md).
